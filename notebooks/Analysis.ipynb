    "We separate the cell lines into two groups according to their WGD status\n",
    "(WGD+ and WGD--) in order to study the differential expression of genes\n",
    "of interest. In particular, we focus on P53, a tumor suppressor gene,\n",
    "and RAD51, which is involved in DNA repair. This comparison aims to\n",
    "determine whether the presence of a Whole Genome Duplication influences\n",

    "\n",
    "We import the pandas library, which allows us to manipulate and analyze\n",
    "data in tabular form. We then create a DataFrame (data table) by reading\n",

    "This script successively displays two subsets of the original table:\n",
